# Facebook Import PoC
This PoC models how data collected through HTTP GET requests to the Facebook API can be exported into a single column in Excel for data analysis.

## RestSharp
To model this, this project is using a simple REST and HTTP API Client for .NET called RestSharp.
You can find their project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp).
